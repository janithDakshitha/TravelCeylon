          <h1>The Scared City Of Anuradhapura</h1>
          <p>This sacred city was established around a cutting from the 'tree of enlightenment', the Buddha's fig tree, brought there in the 3rd century B.C. by Sanghamitta, the founder of an order of Buddhist nuns. Anuradhapura, a Ceylonese political and religious capital that flourished for 1,300 years, was abandoned after an invasion in 993. Hidden away in dense jungle for many years, the splendid site, with its palaces, monasteries and monuments, is now accessible once again.</p>

          <h1>Mihinthale</h1>
          <p>All over the world, high places are given religious significance, with the result that devotees are always climbing steps. Sometimes on their knees. Mihintale is one such place, its various shrines connected by a total of some 1,840 steps that ultimately lead to the summit – steep enough to require deep breaths and a meditative pace. They were built in the reign of Bhathika Abhaya (22 BC–AD 7), although a later paved road provides a short cut up to the first level.</p>

          <h1>Ruwanwelisaya</h1>
          <p>Ruwanweliseya Stupa (Ruwanveli Seya Stupa), the foremost of the supremely glorious ancient living monuments of Sinhalese Buddhist Heritage at the city of Anuradhapura (a UNESCO World Heritage Site-Culture) was built by King Dutugamunu (161-137 BC), the Hero of the Nation, who hailed from Ruhuna, which was destined to give birth to most of the glorious heroes of the island nation of Sri Lanka from the ancient era to the modern day. Ruwanweliseya Stupa (Ruwanveli Seya Stupa) also called Maha Stupa (Sinhala: the great dagoba) or Ratnapali Stupa or Swarnamali stupa has been the most adored, most venerated among the great ancient stupas (dagobas) of Sri Lanka. Anuradhapura is replete with the ancient cultural monuments located in between the River Malwatu Oya and two great ancient man-made irrigation reservoirs called Tissa Wewa and Abhaya Wewa (Basawakkulama Wewa). These two ancient irrigation reservoirs, together with ancient Nuwara Wewa reservoir on the eastern flank of the River Malwatu Oya, extend the lifeline to the agricultural district of Anuradhapura.</p>

          <h1>Jayasrimaha Bodiya</h1>
          <p>This sacred tree has been planted in the historical Maha Megha Vana Royal Park in Anuradhapura in the month of ‘Unduvap’ (December), 236 BC, according to the written facts. The sacred Bodhi sapling has been ceremonially brought here by Arahant Sanghamitta Maha Theree, under instructions of Arahant Mihindu Maha Thero. King Devanampiyatissa who ruled Sri Lanka in this period has planted this Bodhi tree with great pageantry in the Maha Megha Vana Royal Park dedicated to the venerable bhikkhus. The present age of the Anuradhapura Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is 2,247 years.</p>

          <h1>Jethawanarama stupa</h1>
          <p>The Jetavanaramaya is a stupa located in the ruins of Jetavana in the sacred world heritage city of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. Mahasena of Anuradhapura (273–301) initiated the construction of the stupa following the destruction of the mahavihara. His son Maghavanna I completed the construction of the stupa. A part of a sash or belt tied by the Buddha is believed to be the relic that is enshrined here.</p>

          <h1>Lovamahapaya</h1>
          <p>Lovamahapaya in Sri Lanka, also known as the Brazen Palace or Lohaprasada, is a set of ruins with hundreds and hundreds of stone pillars that lie between the stupa Ruvanvelisaya and the Great Bodhi Tree of Anuradhapura. This is the location of a once mighty nine storied monastic structure built by the King Dutugemmunu in the 2nd century BC.</p>

          <h1>Isurumuniya Temple</h1>
          <p>The Isurumuniya Viharaya was constructed during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa who governed in Anuradhapura, the country’s capital. During his reign 500 high caste children were ordained, and Isurumuniya was built as a monastic complex to house all of them. Thereafter it was renovated by King Kasyapa (473 – 491 AD) who renamed it “Boupulvan Kasubgiri Radmaha Vehera” – a combination of his name along with his two daughters’. Connected to the Temple is a cave with a cliff above it. A small Dagoba was built on this cliff during a later period. At the picturesque entrance to Isurumuniya a rock can be seen either side of a crevice, and this rock seems to rise out of a pond.</p>

          <h1>Sadakada Pahana</h1>
          <p>Anuradhapura Sandakada Pahana (Moonstone) is a unique feature of the Sinhala architecture in ancient Sri Lanka which is usually found at the bottom of staircases and entrances. It is a finely carved semi-circular stone slab and symbolises the cycle of Saṃsāra in Buddhism according to historians. Initially, the Sandakada Pahana was placed at the entrances to Buddhist temples during the latter stages of the Anuradhapura period.</p>

          <h1>Samadi Statue</h1>
          <p>The Samadhi Statue is a statue situated at Mahamevnāwa Park in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. The Buddha is depicted in the position of the Dhyana Mudra, the posture of meditation associated with his first Enlightenment, also called Nirvana. Whether the Buddha’s Enlightenment was the experience technically called Samadhi, or some other phenomenon, may depend upon the philosophical allegiance of the believer. In the Dhyana Mudra the Buddha sits cross – legged with his upturned palms placed one over the other on his lap. This position is universally known throughout the Buddhist world, and this statue is therefore one of the most typical pieces of Buddhist sculpture. It is not to be confused with the very similar “Earth-Touching Mudra,” which depicts the simple action the Buddha took to fend off the illusions projected by Mara, who was desperate to prevent the Buddha from realizing that his, Mara’s, projections, and with them the entire world, are an illusion. This statue is 8 feet in height and carved from granite.</p>

          <h1>Ritigala Forest Monestry</h1>
          <p>Ritigala mountain consists of four peaks which rise steeply from the surrounding plain. The mountain is 6.5 km in length, and divided into northern and southern blocks by Maha-Degala Gorge. The highest peak is Ritigala Kanda in the southern block.Its elevation is higher than the other main tourist attractions of the north central plains, namely Sigiriya, Dambulla, and Mihintale. The significance of this topographical feature lies in the abrupt sheerness of the massif, its wooded slopes, and the wet microclimate at the summit.</p>
