          <h1>The Scared City Of Anuradhapura</h1>
          <p>This sacred city was established around a cutting from the 'tree of enlightenment', the Buddha's fig tree, brought there in the 3rd century B.C. by Sanghamitta, the founder of an order of Buddhist nuns. Anuradhapura, a Ceylonese political and religious capital that flourished for 1,300 years, was abandoned after an invasion in 993. Hidden away in dense jungle for many years, the splendid site, with its palaces, monasteries and monuments, is now accessible once again.</p>

          <h1>Mihinthale</h1>
          <p>Globally, elevated locations have religious importance, resulting in constant stair climbing by worshippers. Occasionally on their knees. Mihintale is one such location; its many shrines are linked by a total of 1,840 stairs, which finally climb to the peak and are steep enough to need deep breaths and a deliberate pace. They were constructed during the time of Bhathika Abhaya (22 B.C.–7 A.D.), although a subsequent paved road allows a shortcut to the first level.</p>

          <h1>Ruwanwelisaya</h1>
          <p>Ruwanweliseya Stupa, the foremost of the supremely glorious ancient living monuments of Sinhalese Buddhist Heritage at the city of Anuradhapura (a UNESCO World Heritage Site-Culture), was constructed by King Dutugamunu (161-137 BC), the Hero of the Nation, who hailed from Ruhuna, which was destined to be the birthplace of the majority of the glorious heroes of the Ruwanweliseya Stupa (Ruwanveli Seya Stupa), also known as Maha Stupa (Sinhala: the big stupa) or Ratnapali Stupa or Swarnamali stupa, is the most revered and admired among Sri Lanka's historic stupas (dagobas). Anuradhapura is filled with old cultural sites situated between the Malwatu Oya River and the Tissa Wewa and Abhaya Wewa ancient irrigation lakes (Basawakkulama Wewa). These two historic irrigation lakes, together with the old Nuwara Wewa reservoir on the eastern bank of the River Malwatu Oya, are the lifeblood of Anuradhapura's agricultural area.</p>

          <h1>Jayasrimaha Bodiya</h1>
          <p>According to recorded records, this holy tree was established in the ancient Maha Megha Vana Royal Park in Anuradhapura in the month of "Unduvap" (December) 236 B.C. Arahant Sanghamitta Maha Theree has brought the holy Bodhi seedling here in accordance with the directions of Arahant Mihindu Maha Thero. King Devanampiyatissa, who governed Sri Lanka at this time, placed this Bodhi tree in the Maha Megha Vana Royal Park, which is devoted to the revered bhikkhus, with great ceremony. The Anuradhapura Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is now 2,247 years old.</p>

          <h1>Jethawanarama stupa</h1>
          <p>The Jetavanaramaya is a stupa found among the ruins of Jetavana in the Sri Lankan city of Anuradhapura, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Following the demolition of the mahavihara, Mahasena of Anuradhapura (273–301) commenced the building of the stupa. His son Maghavanna I finished the stupa's construction. It is thought that the relic placed here is a portion of a sash or belt worn by the Buddha.</p>

          <h1>Lovamahapaya</h1>
          <p>The ruins of Lovamahapaya in Sri Lanka, also known as the Brazen Palace or Lohaprasada, are comprised of countless stone pillars and are located between the stupa Ruvanvelisaya and the Great Bodhi Tree of Anuradhapura. In the second century B.C., King Dutugemmunu erected here a once-impressive, nine-story monastery edifice.</p>

          <h1>Isurumuniya Temple</h1>
          <p>The Isurumuniya Viharaya was built during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa, who ruled from the country's capital, Anuradhapura. During his reign, 500 children of high caste were ordained, and Isurumuniya was constructed to accommodate them all. Afterwards, King Kasyapa (473 – 491 AD) restored it and called it "Boupulvan Kasubgiri Radmaha Vehera" — a combination of his name and the names of his two daughters. A cave connected to the Temple has a cliff above it. On this cliff, a tiny Dagoba was constructed at a later time. At the lovely entrance to Isurumuniya, on each side of a cleft is a rock that seems to sprout from a pond.</p>

          <h1>Sadakada Pahana</h1>
          <p>Anuradhapura Sandakada Pahana (Moonstone) is a distinctive element of ancient Sri Lankan Sinhala architecture that is often seen at the base of stairs and doorways. According to historians, this exquisitely carved semicircular stone slab symbolizes the Buddhist cycle of Sasra. During the last phases of the Anuradhapura era, the Sandakada Pahana was first put at the entrances of Buddhist temples.</p>

        <section class="grid">
          <img src="images/samdistatue.webp" alt="2">
          <h1>Samadi Statue</h1>
          <p>The Samadhi Statue is a statue placed in Mahamevnāwa Park in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. The Buddha is represented in the Dhyana Mudra, the meditation posture connected with his first Enlightenment, also known as Nirvana. Whether the Buddha's Enlightenment was the experience formally known as Samadhi or some other event depends on the adherent's worldview. Buddha sits cross-legged with his hands positioned one on top of the other on his lap in the Dhyana Mudra. This stance is well-known across the Buddhist community, making this statue one of the most typical examples of Buddhist art. It should not be mistaken with the very similar "Earth-Touching Mudra," which portrays the simple gesture the Buddha used to repel the illusions projected by Mara, who was anxious to prevent the Buddha from discovering that Mara's projections, and by extension the whole universe, are an illusion. This figure is fashioned from granite and is eight feet tall.</p>

          <img src="images/ritigala.webp" alt="1">
          <h1>Ritigala Forest Monestry</h1>
          <p>The four summits of Ritigala mountain rise sharply from the surrounding plain. The length of the mountain is 6.5 kilometers, and the Maha-Degala Gorge divides it into northern and southern pieces. In the southern block, Ritigala Kanda is the tallest summit. It has a greater elevation than the other major tourist sites of the north central plains, Sigiriya, Dambulla, and Mihintale. The importance of this topographical feature resides in the massif's severe verticality, its forested slopes, and the moist environment at the summit.</p>
