          <h1>The Royal Palace of King Parakramabahu</h1>
          <p>This was a 7 storeyed building with about 1000 rooms, built by the King Parakramabahu the Great (1153-1186). It is located in Polonnaruwa District of North Central Province, Sri Lanka. This place is considered to be the Palace of King Parakramabahu the Great. The Palace was called as Vijayotpaya or Vijayanta Prasada (the name of the Palace of God Sakra). Since it has consisted of 7 stories, the building also called “Sathbumupaya” (in Sinhala).  The remaining huge walls with thickness over one meter and part of stairs and the foundation walls give you an idea about the size of the building.</p>

          <p>One of the more unique structures built by King Nissankamalla in the 1100s, the Nissanka Latha Mandapaya is believed to be the recitation house for Buddhist chanting (pirith), and still stands as an important monument that showcases how the religion of Buddhism influenced society back in the day. The monument is located in the western end of the ‘Dalada Maluwa’ (the place in which the Sacred Tooth Relic was housed), making its significance all the more relevant in the annals of Sri Lankan history. The complex is also known to be the ‘King’s Court’ by some archaeologists.</p>

          <h1>Gal Viharaya</h1>
          <p>Gal Vihara (Sinhala: stone temple), Buddhist Temple at (UNESCO World Heritage Site) at Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka is the most perfect specimen of Buddha statue hewn out of solid stone. Crafted during the reign of King Parakrabahu (1153-1186 A.C), Gal Vihara statues are still incomplete preservation with their irresistible charm and sublimity. It is undeniable that the sculptors of Gal Vihara were of greater skill and expertise in the art of stone sculpture in Sri Lanka. The images at Gal Vihara have brought about a higher level of awakening in the observers with respect to Buddhist art in Sri Lanka.</p>

          <h1>Pothgul Viharaya</h1>
          <p>The Pothgul Viharaya is exactly as its name suggests, a library and monastery complex.  It is the oldest one in the whole of Sri Lanka. The term “Pothgul” literally translating as a place to store books. It was constructed under the sponsorship of Parakramabahu of Polonnaruwa (1153-1185 AD ruling period). Thereafter, it was renovated under the patronage of his consort Queen Chandrawathie.The plan of the complex is set in a square set of foundations. Then a number of them within the others with a circular structure in the center of the smallest and innermost square. This may have been the main area for storing books. It may have been completely composed of bricks, covering a rather large area within its confines.</p>

          <h1>Rankoth Vehera</h1>
          <p>Ruwanweli is a stupa built by the king Nissanka Malla who ruled Polonnaruwa (AD 1187 – 1196). It was constructed in the style of the original Anuradhaphura Maha Vihara monastery stupas, bearing a close resemblance to one of the most famous stupas of Sri Lanka – ‘Ruwanwelisaya’. The original name of the stupa indicates that perhaps this resemblance was intentional. However the name was changed later on to ‘Rankoth Vehera’. ‘Ran’ means gold, and ‘koth’ is the word used for the pinnacle of a stupa in the Sinhalese language. Hence Rankoth Vehera approximates in English to ‘Stupa with the Golden pinnacle’. Rankoth Vehera is one of the most well-known and revered stupas of the Polonnaruwa era.</p>

          <h1>Statue of The King Parakramabahu</h1>
          <p>The Parakramabahu statue is the large statue facing the massive Parakrama Samudra Reservoir in Polonnaruwa Ancient City. The statue is located in the vicinity of the Potgul Vihara monastic complex and was built by king Parakramabahu I.  Sometimes its is said that the Parakramabahu statue is a portrait of the great king. Furthermore, at times it is thought to be that of a sage, Rishi Pulastya. The figure itself is carved into a large rock during the 12th Century AD. It is one of the finest stone statues belonging to this period. Close to twelve feet tall, this statue is of a man with a grave, but wise expression with half-closed eyes and a sad smile as he reads from what most think is a manuscript he holds in his hands at around chest height.</p>

          <h1>Kiri Vehera</h1>
          <p>This large stupa known as the Kiri Vehera of Polonnaruwa, lying north of Lankathilaka Pilima Ge is said to be built by a queen of king Parakramabahu (1153-1186) called “Subadra”. The original name of this has been “Rupavathi Stupa” and this too is a part of Alahana Privena and stands 80 feet in height today.</p>
