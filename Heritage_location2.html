          <h1>The Royal Palace of King Parakramabahu</h1>
          <p>This seven-story, 1,000-room structure was constructed by King Parakramabahu the Great (1153-1186). It is situated in the Polonnaruwa District of Sri Lanka's North Central Province. This location is regarded as King Parakramabahu the Great's palace. The name of the palace was either Vijayotpaya or Vijayanta Prasad (the name of the Palace of God Sakra). Since it has seven floors, the building is also known as "Sathbumupaya" (in Sinhala). The surviving massive walls with a thickness of almost one meter, a portion of the staircase, and the foundation walls provide an indication of the magnitude of the structure.</p>

          <h1>Polonnaruwa Watadageya</h1>
          <p>The Polonnaruwa Vatadage is a historic edifice that dates back to the Sri Lankan Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. It is believed to have been constructed during the reign of Parakramabahu I to house the Buddha's tooth relic or during the reign of Nissanka Malla of Polonnaruwa to house the Buddha's alms bowl.</p>

          <h1>Nishshanka Latha Mandapaya</h1>
          <p>The Nissanka Latha Mandapaya, one of the most unusual constructions erected by King Nissankamalla in the 1100s, is thought to be the recitation house for Buddhist chanting (pirith) and remains an important landmark that demonstrates how Buddhism affected life back then. The monument's location near the western end of the 'Dalada Maluwa' (the location where the Sacred Tooth Relic was stored) increases its prominence in Sri Lankan historical records. Various archaeologists refer to the complex as the "King's Court."</p>

          <h1>Gal Viharaya</h1>
          <p>Gal Vihara (Sinhala: stone temple), Buddhist Temple in (UNESCO World Heritage Site) Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka, is the finest example of a Buddha figure carved from a single block of stone. Gal Vihara sculptures, created during the time of King Parakrabahu (1153-1186 B.C. ), are incompletely preserved despite their seductive attraction and sublime beauty. In Sri Lanka, it is obvious that the sculptors of Gal Vihara had superior talent and experience in the art of stone carving. Regarding Buddhist art in Sri Lanka, the pictures at Gal Vihara have awakened onlookers to a higher degree of consciousness.</p>

          <h1>Lankathilaka Temple</h1>
          <p>Located south of Kiri Vehera, the Polonnaruwa Lankathilaka Image House is a monolithic Buddha image house constructed by King Parakramabahu (1153-1186). The whole structure is constructed from bricks, and its outside walls are adorned with intricate motifs and carvings. The Buddha statue is constructed entirely of clay bricks and is 41 feet tall. This statue was constructed using specially crafted flat bricks, and the area above the shoulder has been demolished.</p>

          <h1>Pothgul Viharaya</h1>
          <p>The Pothgul Viharaya is a library and monastery complex, as its name indicates. It is the oldest structure in Sri Lanka. The name "Pothgul" translates directly to "place to keep books." It was built with the support of Parakramabahu of Polonnaruwa (1153-1185 AD ruling period). Subsequently, it was rebuilt with the support of his spouse, Queen Chandrawathie. The complex's design is based on a square set of foundations. Then, a number of them are placed inside the others, with a circular construction in the middle of the smallest and most interior square. This may have been the primary location for book storage. It may have been entirely constructed of bricks and encompassed a considerable area.</p>

          <h1>Rankoth Vehera</h1>
          <p>Ruwanweli is a stupa constructed by the Polonnaruwa-ruling king Nissanka Malla (1187â€“1187). It was built in the manner of the ancient Anuradhapura Maha Vihara monastery stupas and closely resembles one of Sri Lanka's most renowned stupas, 'Ruwanwelisaya'. The ancient name of the stupa suggests that this likeness may have been deliberate. Later on, the name was changed to 'Rankoth Vehera' In the Sinhalese language, 'Ran' denotes gold and 'koth' is the name for a stupa's apex. Therefore, Rankoth Vehera roughly translates as "Stupa with a golden peak" in English. Among the most well-known and respected stupas of the Polonnaruwa period is Rankoth Vehera.</p>

          <h1>Statue of The King Parakramabahu</h1>
          <p>In Polonnaruwa Ancient City, the Parakramabahu statue is the enormous monument facing the vast Parakrama Samudra Reservoir. The monument was erected by King Parakramabahu I in the area of the Potgul Vihara monastery complex. It is often stated that the statue of Parakramabahu is a picture of the famous ruler. In addition, it is often attributed to the sage Rishi Pulastya. The figure is carved into a massive rock during the 12th century A.D., making it one of the greatest sculptures made of stone from this time period. This almost twelve-foot-tall statue depicts a man with a somber yet wise look, half-closed eyes, and a sorrowful smile as he reads from what most believe to be a book he holds in his hands at chest level..</p>

          <h1>Kiri Vehera</h1>
          <p>This large stupa, known as the Kiri Vehera of Polonnaruwa and located north of Lankathilaka Pilima Ge, was reportedly constructed by Subadra, a queen of King Parakramabahu (1153-1186). This structure's original name was "Rupavathi Stupa," and it is also a part of Alahana Privena. Its current height is 80 feet.</p>
