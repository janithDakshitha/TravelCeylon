    <h1>Activities</h1>
    <h3>Surfing</h3>
    <p>Whether you're a seasoned pro or have yet to learn how to stand on a surfboard, you'll be in ecstasy in Sri Lanka, since the country is known worldwide for its excellent surfing breaks. Because of the varying weather conditions along its coasts throughout the year, this country may be visited at any time of the year. The rains also come from all directions at once. To put it another way, there will always be waves. In the south, the best time to go is between November and May, while on the east coast, the best time to go is between April and October, when the waves are at their longest. In the southwest, you'll find Unawatuna and Hikkaduwa, while in the south you'll find Weligama and in the east you'll find Arugam Bay. Get in touch with the Surf South Sri Lanka crew for the most up-to-date information on today's surf conditions.</p>
    
    <h2>Most attractive places to surfing</h2>

          <img src="images/koggala.webp" alt="1">
          <h3>Koggala beach</h3>
          <p>This south Sri Lankan beach is known for its fisherman living on stilts and is a great place for both experienced surfers and those just starting out to hone their skills. Winter is when circumstances are ideal, but Koggala cannot guarantee consistent breaks even then. Weligama Beach break, located nearby, is ideal for novice surfers since it is protected from prevailing winds and has small, but potentially dangerous, waves that may reach up to 1.5 meters in height (5ft). The surf at Midigama provide for extended rides. At Ahangama, located only 20 minutes away, surfers of a more advanced skill level may ride waves as high as 2.5m during the peak season (January and February) (8ft).</p>

          <h3>Ahangama Beach</h3>
          <p>In the Southern Province, where surfing is king, you may find some serious athletes. There are a number of surf camps in this little town because of its proximity to the waves at Weligama, Unawatuna, Mirissa, and Midigama. The shallow reef in the area also draws serious snorkelers. You can catch some waves right off this lengthy stretch of beach, and then cool down in the shade of the jungle's palm trees. From December to March, the dry season brings offshore winds and solid surf. May through September is the rainy season, although you may still find surfable waves.</p>

          <h3>Balapitiya</h3>
          <p>Visit this fishing community for its golden beaches and to see the impressive kraal-fishing structures made of reeds and rods that are pushed into the riverbed to capture passing creatures. This southwest region, some 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Colombo and accessible either coastal road or rail, is known for its tranquility and traditional way of life. Exposed reef breaks produce pretty consistent surfing, but for the finest waves, go to Hikkaduwa, which is just 30 minutes away.</p>

    <h1>Hiking</h1>
    <p>Many tourists only see the white sands and turquoise waters of Sri Lanka's coasts, but the island's rocky interior and its towering mountains hide a whole other world. Only when trains were constructed across the highlands did driving become the primary mode of transportation on this beautiful tropical island. Within striking distance of the shore, modern-day hikers may reach a world of rocky ruins, religious places, spectacular views, and falling tea farms.</p>

          <img src="images/admspeak.webp" alt="1">
          <h3>Adam's Peak</h3>
          <p>Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, and Christians all hold Sri Lanka's holiest mountain in the highest regard. It is known by many different names, including Adam's Peak (the place where Adam first set foot on earth after being cast out of heaven), Sri Pada (the'sacred footprint' left by the Buddha as he headed towards paradise), and Samanalakande (Butterfly Mountain, where butterflies go to die). The daybreak ascent of the 5,200 stairs from Dalhousie village to the hilltop is as much a spiritual adventure as it is a physical excursion, providing a glimpse into Sri Lanka's soul as well as breathtaking panoramas.</p>

      <section class="Hcontainer">
          <img src="images/ellarock.webp" alt="1">
          <h3>Little Adam's Peak and Ella Rock</h3>
          <p>Hikers may find maps of the paths that go between the ridges to tea plantations, waterfalls, and vantage spots at almost every guest house in Ella. You may spend days just exploring the area around the Nine Arches Bridge, stopping at scenic overlooks, and taking pictures (or watching other people do it on Instagram). After a long day of hiking, guests at a guesthouse may look forward to a delicious home-cooked lunch.</p>
          <p>Begin your adventures with a 4.5km round-trip to Little Adam's Peak, a grassy knoll with spectacular views of waterfalls and tea factories emerging from the mist that envelops the surrounding hills. The 10-kilometer hike to Ella Rock is more difficult, but also more rewarding; a steady ascent through typical highland terrain, beginning on the railroad lines at Ella Station. A last rise through eucalyptus groves will bring you to a rocky ledge with breathtaking views of the hill area (and mobs of resident monkeys waiting to relieve you of any snacks you brought along for the journey).</p>

          <h3>Sinharaja Forest Reserve</h3>
          <p>The majority of hikers base themselves in Deniyaya or Kudawa, where you may buy admission tickets and organise a journey with the guides that are stationed at the park's entrance. Before the tour groups come from the coast, visit the park early in the morning when the paths are peaceful and the wildlife is at its most active. The Sinharaja Rain Forest View Villas at Deniyaya are a beautiful forest retreat that won't break your travel budget.</p>
