    <h1>Hikkaduwa Beach</h1>
    <img src="images/1_262_02.webp" alt="3">
    <p>The quaint seaside community of Hikkaduwa is another island treasure. You may go scuba diving and snorkeling in paradise from January to March, and the rest of the year you can just relax and soak up the sun, sea, and sand. Hikkaduwa is widely considered to be one of Sri Lanka's best beaches. Since it has seen more development than other coastal areas, you will discover a plethora of options for both eating and sleeping. However, if you'd rather avoid the crowds, you can easily do so by renting a scooter and heading to one of the area's smaller beaches. If you're lucky, you can see one of the several huge turtles that live in this area above water.</p>

    <h1>Arugam Bay</h1>
    <img src="images/01.webp" alt="4">
    <p>Arugam Bay is the ultimate laid-back surfing haven. Located on Sri Lanka's eastern coast, the area is ideally suited to receive swells and waves. Around the world's best surfers make their way to this obscure town for the season. Because of this, Arugam's culture is surprisingly rich and varied, considering the island's small size.</p>

    <h1>Unawatuna</h1>
    <img src="images/700105_62270808.webp" alt="5">
    <p>The first on the list, this beach provides everything a traveler could want. Pure, golden sand awaits guests, ready to be lain on as they soak up some rays. Water sports and wildlife excursions are available for the more active visitors. Unawatuna is the most popular beach on Sri Lanka's southern coast due to its proximity to the dynamic city of Galle. Though it is one of the most visited beaches in Sri Lanka, the nicest beach in the country is seldom as congested as those in neighboring Spain and Bali. To me, Unawatuna strikes the perfect balance between an active nightlife and a relaxed atmosphere.</p>
    <p>The beach forms a horseshoe around a tranquil bay. Natural conditions are ideal for water sports like swimming and snorkeling. You may often see turtles on the beach at night, when the females return to lay their eggs. There are busy restaurants and bistros selling fresh seafood and tuneful music among the coconut palm palms that border the coast. Those that come to this beach won't be let down.</p>
